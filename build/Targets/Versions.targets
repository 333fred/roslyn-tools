         started that day). So the first build of the day, 20160615.1, will produce something similar to BuildNumberFiveDigitDateStamp: 60615,
         BuildNumberBuildOfTheDayPadded: 01; and the 12th build of the day, 20160615.12, will produce BuildNumberFiveDigitDateStamp: 60615, BuildNumberBuildOfTheDay: 12 -->
    <!-- Additionally, in order ensure the value fits in the 16-bit PE header fields, we will only take the last five digits of the BuildNumber, so
         in the case of 20160615, we will set BuildNumberFiveDigitDateStamp to 60615. This will begin failing in the 2017 as the BuildVersion only allows
         each part to be in the range of 0 through 65535. Issue #12038 tracks the fix that needs to happen. -->
